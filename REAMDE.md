# Blockain discovery project

This repo has been made to store my researches about smart contracts. It takes part of a class I am attending, about blockchains.

## Content

There are three contracts in this repo :
- my_contract : a first contract that has one variable that can be incremented or reset.
- minescoin : simulation of a fundraiser by pre-selling tokens of my future blockchain. 
- chocolatine_pole : a contract that organises a vote on the Tezos blockchain to decide which from "chocolatine" or "pain au chocolat" is the right name for the famous viennoiserie.
